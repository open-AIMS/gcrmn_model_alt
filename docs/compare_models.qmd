## Purpose

The primary purpose of this page is to contrast the ability of various
models to represent the temporal trends of real data from a select set
of Marine Ecosystems Of the World (MEOW). For each MEOW, there will be
modelled trends overlayed onto the raw data. These plots are to permit
those who are familiar with the MEOWs to compare the trends yielded
from different models so as to inform decisions about:

- whether any model types yield trends that are inconsistent with the
  understanding of the experts
- whether the raw data themselves are broadly consistent with
  expectations

The candidate models are:

- `stan` - a bespoke Stan model I wrote for the previous GCRMN report
- `xgboost` - bootstrapped xgboost (boosted regression trees) written
  by Jeremy Wicquart (codes for these models are not presented in this
  document)

## Methods

### Bayesian hierarchical model

#### Modelling considerations

The sampling design of most monitoring programs is typically tailored
somewhere in a spectrum between a configuration of perpetually fixed
sampling sites and a configuration of randomly selected sites,
depending on the purpose, resources and logistics of the program.
Whist fixed sites act as their own baselines over time and thus
provide relatively efficient means for estimating temporal trends, the
resulting estimates are biased towards the selected locations (which
may not be collectively representative of the broader area). By
contrast, a configuration of uniquely random sites each year is less
likely to be biased (hence more representative) and yet usually
requires considerably higher numbers of sites in order to detect
temporal signals from within the noise.

The focus and challenge for the current report is to utilise a
collection of datasets from a large number of disparate monitoring
programs from around the world in order to provide estimates of status
and trends at much broader spatio-temporal scales.

Whenever multiple data sets are integrated together (particularly if
each is used to represent different areas), the issues of
representativeness and bias are exasperated.  Firstly, quantitative
estimates are always driven by sample sizes.  Within any well designed
monitoring program, efforts are made to ensure the design remains
relatively balanced.  However, this is not the case across programs.
Therefore, when aggregating multiple datasets up to a broader scale,
it is important to be able to control for varying samples sizes so as
to minimise the risks of biasing towards the more heavily replicated
data sets.  Moreover, sample size and density does not necessarily
reflect the density and distribution of the underlying landscape.  For
example, in the case of coral reefs, sampling intensity is likely to
be a function of the relative prosperity of the surrounding
populations and proximity to major population centers rather than the
density and distribution of the reefs themselves.

Enormous (and complex) spatio-temporal models that employ full
positional encoding to evaluate the spatial
patterns\footnote{auto-correlative structures} between all possible
pairs of sampling units (sites) have the potential to allow the
transferal of information from the fine, observation level
measurements to the broader levels of this report. By assuming that a
response (such as percentage live hard coral cover) varies
continuously over an entire two-dimensional surface, such models are
potentially able to leverage trends in areas of relatively high sample
density to estimate the trends in neighbouring areas of sparse
sampling density - albeit with greater uncertainty. However such
models proved to be too computationally burdensome and were incredibly
difficult to tune to ensure they yield sensible outcomes. They also
assumed that changes over space were relatively gradual and thus, can
easily smooth over what would otherwise be considered abrupt local
changes. Furthermore, incorporating information about the spatial
distribution of reefs as well as physical barriers to auto-correlative
process are far from trivial.

As an alternative, we explored hierarchical models in which sampling
units are progressively aggregated with their neighbours into larger
and larger units.  For example, neighbouring quadrats are grouped
together into sites, sites into global grid locations (see below) and
so on up to the level of the whole globe.  This represents a
pseudo-spatial model in that although the influence of neighbouring
data does deteriorate along the hierarchy, it does so in increments
relating to group membership rather than as a continuous function of
spatial distance. Hence in the case of an area comprising of ten
sub-areas, each of the sub-areas will share some information with the
other sub-areas even though any one of them might be geographically
closer to a member of another area than most of the sub-areas in its
designated area (the classic nearest vs average neighbour conundrum).
In any case, all attempts to fit full, global hierarchical models with
the very disparate datasets proved very difficult to stabilise.

Instead, smaller hierarchical models (see @fig-schematichierarchy),
fit separately to each MEOW Ecoregion, were integrated together within
a spatially weighted aggregation hierarchy in which individual model
posteriors (annual estimates) were propagated up through the
hierarchy. Although this approach does still have some elements of the
pseudo-spatial hierarchy that permits data poor areas to leverage
patterns off data richer areas, the leveraging is quarantined to
within MEOW Ecoregions where processes are more likely to be
homogeneous and thus the resulting trends are more likely to be
consistent with the observed data. More details about the spatial
weights are discussed in section @sec-weights and the statistical
models are discussed in section @sec-models.

#### Spatial hierarchy

The pseudo-spatial hierarchy outlined above necessitates incremental
jumps in scale from the level at which observations are collected up
to the Global (or even regional) scale.  <!--That is, it is necessary
to group the spatial units up incrementally into larger and large
spatial groups (hence the previously described hierarchy).--> If the
jumps are too large, the information (temporal patterns) shared across
neighbouring spatial units might be driven by very different
underlying conditions and thus not appropriate.

The original datasets collated in this study were provided at scales
of either quadrat/transect or spatial aggregations thereof.  These can
be naturally grouped into sites (or individual reefs) as the first
incremental scale jump, however, subsequent increments are less obvious.

There are numerous ways of grouping coral reef locations into broader
geographic areas, or from the other direction, dividing the globe up
spatially. Some candidates include: Exclusive Economic Zones
[@EEZ-2019], Venon Ecoregions [@Veron-2000] or Marine Ecosystems of
the World
[@Spalding-2007]\footnote{https://www.worldwildlife.org/publications/marine-ecoregions-of-the-world-a-bioregionalization-of-coastal-and-shelf-areas}.
Consensus amongst a large panel of coral reef regional representatives
was that Marine Ecosystems of the World (hereafter MEOW) global
classification system were the most appropriate as it has a strong
bio-geographic focus capturing important, community, evolutionary,
dispersal and isolation processes [@Spalding-2007]. The MEOW
Ecoregions were further grouped up into GCRMN sub-regions and regions
(see tables in the Subregion and Region level outputs) and Figures
@fig-schematichierarchy & @fig-schematic) to provide additional
modelling and reporting granularity.

::: {.figure #fig-schematic}

hypothetical observations (bottom layer) to the level of a 10x10km
grid tile, MEOW Ecoregions, GCRMN Regions and Global scale. The grid
tile layer depicts the 10x10km tile containing reef (red) and the
voronoi polygons (blue lines) used to partition area zones of sample
unit influence. The MEOW Ecoregions layer illustrates five fictitious
Ecoregions which are aggregated into two GCRMN Regions in the layer
above. Vertical lines illustrate the aggregation of data along the
hierarchy and the numbers along these paths represent the aggregation
weights (also tabulated).
:::


The jump in spatial scale from Site (reef) to MEOW Ecoregion can be
very large and span a wide range of influential processes and drivers.
We therefore sought an additional intermediate scale.  Such a scale
could be based on collections of reefs or broad communities, however
such information was not universally available.  An intermediate scale
could also be achieved by gridding the globe up into an array (grid)
of cells or tiles or a constant size.  Moreover, the use of grid tiles
provides a way of abstracting away design differences between fixed
and random annual site selections - and thus a mechanism by which
multiple sampling designs can be incorporated in the one model.

#### Spatial weights {#sec-weights}

In order to help maximise the chances that the hierarchical
aggregations are reflective of broad spatial patterns and not heavily
biased by sampling effort alone, the aggregations must be weighted by
the proportion of reef area represented by each spatial unit.

Estimating the distribution and quantity of global coral reefs is a
challenging problem.  As is the case with sampling effort consistency
across the globe, the granularity and accuracy of coral reef mapping
varies substantially from region to region, Hence, we sought a
potentially less biased and more uniform method of estimating reef
area.

##### Tropical Coral Reefs of the World

As an alternative to the Allen Atlas, Tropical Coral Reefs of the
World [@Burke-2011; @WRI-2011] digital shapefiles were used to estimate the
amount of coral reef.  The intermediate spatial scale between observed
sites and MEOWs was provided by generating a 10x10km grid of tiles
across the entire globe and assigning a unique identifier to each
tile.

###### Tile level weights

All observed site level locations were assigned to an grid tile on the
basis of nearest neighbour within 10km. To estimate the amount of reef
area within each MEOW that was represented by each of the observed
sites, voronoi polygons were generated from the unique site locations
and overlayed onto the grid (see @fig-voronoi). The reef area
associated with each voronoi cell were then expressed as a proportion
of the total MEOW reef area, thereby representing the relative weight
that each grid tile should carry in the analyses.

::: {.figure #fig-voronoi}
![](resources/voronoi-1.png){width=600px}

Illustration of voronoi polygons overlayed on the 10x10km grid and
reefs (grey). Shaded grid tiles represent grid tiles containing
observed sites and hue of the grid tile shading represents the
relative weights (proportion of reef area in each grid tile).
:::


###### Larger scale weights

The weights (relative contributions) of each MEOW Ecoregion in
aggregating up to GCRMN Sub-regions was calculated as the proportion
of MEOW reef area within each GCRMN Sub-region (see @fig-weights).
Similarly, GCRMN Sub-region and Region weights (used in aggregations
to GCRMN Region and Global levels respectively) were calculated from
the respective proportions of reef areas in GCRMN Regions and
Globally.

![](resources/weights_final_version.png){width=600px}

grid tile within three MEOW Ecoregions. The hue of reef fill is
proportional to the relative area of reef in the MEOW.

#### Statistical model {#sec-models}

Live hard coral cover and algal cover were calculated by summing
observation level data across associated taxonomic groupings.

Separate MEOW Ecosystem Bayesian hierarchical models were constructed
within the stan statistical modelling platform [@Carpenter-2017-2017]
via the rstan [@rstan-2025] interface. Each model comprised a model
matrix representing year dumpy coded as cell means contrasts, a model
matrix representing Dataset coded as sum to zero contrasts as well as
varying effects representing the hierarchical structure of Sites
nested within grid tiles ([@fig-schematichierarchy]a).
Weights were also applied to the grid tiles in order to allow the
influence of each grid tile to be proportional to the relative area of
reef each grid tile represented.

Separate models were fitted to explore trends in live hard coral cover
(HCC) and algae cover (A).  In each case, cover was modelled against a
beta distribution (logit link).  Cover values of either 0 or 1 were
first shrunk by 0.01 for compatibility with the beta distribution.
Weakly informative priors were applied to the beta shape parameters as
well as the varying effects parameters and their standard deviations.

In order to impute missing year combinations and smooth over
short-term oscillations in estimates resulting from short-term
fluctuations in sampling designs and data availability, priors on Year
effects (except that associated with the first observed year of data
in a MEOW Ecoregion) were weakly informative normal priors centred
around the posterior of either previous Year (in the case of Years
after the initial observed year) or after (in the case of Years prior
to the initial observed year).  For the initial observed Year,
standard (zero centred) weakly informative priors were applied.

The Dataset effects were included to act as proxies for all the many
and varying ways that different datasets differ including depth,
sampling unit type (quadrats, transects, etc) and observer experience.
Weakly informative normal priors were applied to the Dataset
effects.

The statistical models can be summarised as:

<!--
\begin{align}
  \mathbf{Y} &\sim Beta(\mu\phi, (1-\mu)\phi)\\
  logit(\mu) &= \mathbf{\beta_y} \mathbf{X_y} + \mathbf{\gamma_d} \mathbf{X_d} + \omega\mathbf{\gamma_t} Z_t +
    \mathbf{\gamma_s} Z_s + \mathbf{\gamma_r} Z_r\\
  \mathbf{\gamma_t} &= \sigma_t\times z_t\\
  \mathbf{\gamma_s} &= \sigma_s\times z_s\\
  \mathbf{\gamma_r} &= \sigma_r\times z_r\\
  \phi &\sim \Gamma(0.01,0.01)\\
  z_t,z_s,z_r &\sim N(0,1)\\
  \sigma_t,\sigma_s,\sigma_r &\sim t(3, 0, 1)\\
  \sigma_y &\sim t(3, 0, 0.5)\\ 
  \mathbf{\beta_{y}} &\sim N(\mathbf{y}, \sigma_y)\\ 
  \mathbf{y} &\begin{cases}y=I_y, \sim N(O_y, \sigma_y)\\
     y>I_y, \sim N(\mathbf{y}_{y-1}, 0.1)\\
     y=G_y, \sim N((\mathbf{y}_{y-1} + \mathbf{y}_{y+1})/2, 0.1)\\
     y<F_y, \sim N(\mathbf{y}_{y+1}, 0.1)
  \end{cases}\\
  \mathbf{\gamma_d} = \mathbf{gamma_raw_d} - \bar{\mathbf{gamma_d}}\\
  \mathbf{\gamma_raw_d} & \sim N(0, 0.3)\\
\end{align}

where $\mathbf{Y}$ is a vector of the cover of the benthic group
(e.g. either live hard coral, macroalgae, algae, etc),
$\mathbf{\beta_y}$ and $\mathbf{X_y}$ represent the effects of Year
and cell-means (no intercept) Year model matrices respectively.
$\mathbf{\gamma_d}$ and $\mathbf{X_d}$ represent the effects of
Dataset ID and the associated model matrix.  $\mathbf{\gamma_d}$ is
mean centered to ensure it sums-to-zero so that the $\beta$ parameters
apply to the average Dataset (rather than the first level).
$\mathbf{\gamma_g}$, $\mathbf{\gamma_s}$ and $\mathbf{\gamma_r}$ are
the sum-to-zero varying effects, and $Z_g$, $Z_s$ and $Z_r$ represent
the Grid_id, Site and Transect/Replicate codes
respectively. $\mathbf{y}$ represents year hyperparameters and $y$ is
a year iterator. $I_y$ and $O_y$ represent the initial observed year
and mean observed response within the MEOW Ecoregion.  $F_{y}$ and
$G_{y}$ represent final observed year and gap years within the MEOW
Ecoregion.  Weakly informative priors (on the link scale) are applied
to the $\sigma$ hyperpriors as well as $\Gamma$.  Since \mathbf{Y} are
hyperpriors on the expected $\beta$ and are based on lags from
surrounding estimates, the priors had narrower spread so as to offer
some regularisation in the expected change in cover over a single
year.  Simularly, the prior on the sum-to-zero effect of Dataset ID
was more informative since there were numerous incidences in which
different Datasets did not overlap in space and/or time.  Hence
without less weak priors, there was a strong possibility of the models
doubling up on trying to account for differences in Datasets, space
and time resulting in highly inflated uncertainties.

\begin{align}
  \mathbf{Y} &\sim Beta(\mu\phi, (1-\mu)\phi)\\
  logit(\mu) &= \mathbf{\beta_y} \mathbf{X_y} + \mathbf{\gamma_d} \mathbf{X_d} + \omega\mathbf{\gamma_t} Z_t +
    \mathbf{\gamma_s} Z_s + \mathbf{\gamma_r} Z_r\\
  \mathbf{\gamma_t} &= \sigma_t\times z_t\\
  \mathbf{\gamma_s} &= \sigma_s\times z_s\\

  \phi &\sim \Gamma(0.01,0.01)\\
  z_t,z_s,z_r &\sim N(0,1)\\
  \sigma_t,\sigma_s,\sigma_r &\sim t(3, 0, 1)\\
  \sigma_y &\sim t(3, 0, 0.5)\\ 
  \mathbf{\beta_{y}} &\sim N(\mathbf{y}, \sigma_y)\\ 
  \mathbf{y} &\begin{cases}y=I_y, \sim N(O_y, \sigma_y)\\
     y>I_y, \sim N(\mathbf{y}_{y-1}, 0.1)\\
     y=G_y, \sim N((\mathbf{y}_{y-1} + \mathbf{y}_{y+1})/2, 0.1)\\
     y<F_y, \sim N(\mathbf{y}_{y+1}, 0.1)
  \end{cases}\\
  \mathbf{\gamma_d} & \sim N(0, 0.3)\\
\end{align}

where $\mathbf{Y}$ is a vector of the cover of the benthic group
(e.g. either live hard coral, macroalgae, algae, etc),
$\mathbf{\beta_y}$ and $\mathbf{X_y}$ represent the effects of Year
and cell-means (no intercept) Year model matrices respectively.
$\mathbf{\gamma_d}$ and $\mathbf{X_d}$ represent the effects of
Dataset ID and the associated sum-to-zero model matrix such that the
$\beta$ parameters apply to the average Dataset (rather than the first
level).  $\mathbf{\gamma_g}$, $\mathbf{\gamma_s}$ and
$\mathbf{\gamma_r}$ are the sum-to-zero varying effects, and $Z_g$,
$Z_s$ and $Z_r$ represent the Grid_id, Site and Transect/Replicate
codes respectively. $\mathbf{y}$ represents year hyperparameters and
$y$ is a year iterator. $I_y$ and $O_y$ represent the initial observed
year and mean observed response within the MEOW Ecoregion.  $F_{y}$
and $G_{y}$ represent final observed year and gap years within the
MEOW Ecoregion.  Weakly informative priors (on the link scale) were
applied to the $\sigma$ hyperpriors as well as $\Gamma$.  Since
$\mathbf{Y}$ are hyperpriors on the expected $\beta$ and are based on
lags from surrounding estimates, the priors had narrower spread so as
to offer some regularisation in the expected change in cover over a
single year.  Simularly, the prior on the sum-to-zero effect of
Dataset ID was more informative since there were numerous incidences
in which different Datasets did not overlap in space and/or time.
Hence without less weak priors, there was a strong possibility of the
models doubling up on trying to account for differences in Datasets,
space and time resulting in highly inflated uncertainties.

Estimates of annual benthic cover thereafter comprised of inverse-link
transformed $\beta$ estimates for the years for which there were
observed data and $\mathbf{Y}$ estimates were used to fill in the gaps
(years for which there were no observed data).  This methodology
enabled us to generate cover estimates that were unsmoothed for data
years (thereby permitting rapid change) whilst still providing
estimates of cover during the temporal gaps that transitioned between
the bookends of the gaps and with uncertainty increasing distal to the
bookends.

<!-- Trends in hard coral cover to algae ratio (HCC:A)
employed structurally very similar models to those described above,
yet the ratio was modelled against a Gaussian distribution.  -->

All models were run with 10000 no-u-turn MCMC iterations, a warmup of
5000 and a thinning rate of 5 for each of three chains (each with
random initial values). The adaptive delta was elevated to 0.99 to
reduce the incidences of post-warmup divergences.  Diagnostics
indicated that all chains converged on stable, well mixed posteriors
(Rhat values < 1.05) and low MCMC sample auto-correlation (< 0.2).

#### Hierarchical aggregation

The full posteriors for the Year effects (on the logit scale) of each
MEOW Ecoregion were averaged together within each GCRMN Sub-region
([@fig-schematichierarchy]b).  The resulting posteriors were
then summarised by back-transforming to the response scale (inverse
logit transform in the case of beta models) and calculating the means
and highest probability density intervals (80\% and 95\%).  Similarly,
the un-standardised GCRMN Sub-region posteriors were aggregated (with
weights) up to GCRMN Region and then Global level
(see [@fig-schematichierarchy]b & [@fig-schematic]).


### (Bootstrapped) xgboost (boosted regression tree) model

<!--
Jeremy Wicquart has developed an xbgoost model that incorporates a
suite of environmental covariates in addition to space and time.  The
outputs of these models (at each of ecoregion, subregion and region)
were provided in a single spreadsheet and are presented along side the
Bayesian Hierarchical models in the sections below.
-->

Over the past three decades, numerous studies have assessed temporal
trends in the percentage cover of hard corals and other benthic
categories at broad spatial scales. Most of these studies aggregated
data from multiple monitoring programs and interpreted trends by
plotting mean annual hard coral cover together with associated
confidence intervals (e.g. Gardner et al., 2003; Obura et al.,
2017). Other studies applied statistical models to investigate the
factors driving temporal variation in percentage cover (Bruno and
Selig, 2007; De’ath et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2014; Tebbett et
al., 2023b).

- the dark blue line represents the mean of the cover estimates
  (bootstrapped xgboost model)
- the blue band represents the 95% interval of cover estimates
  (bootstrapped xgboost model)
- the white line represents the posterior median of cover estimates
  (Bayesian Heirarchical model)
- the darkest orange band represents the 80% credibility interval of
  cover estimates (Bayesian Heirarchical model)
- the orange band represents the 95% credibility interval of the
  cover estimates (Bayesian Heirarchical model)
- the light orange band represents the 95% credibility interval of
  cover estimates for years in which there were no observed data in
  the presented spatial scale (e.g. Ecoregion, Subregion or Region)
  (Bayesian Heirarchical model).
- in the case of Subregions and Regions, the light orange band only
  appears for spans of years for which there were no observations
  across all the consistuent spatial units.



<!--
Note, the weights used in the aggregation of the Bayesian Hierarchical
models are recycled from the 2020 GCRMN analysis and need to be
updated.  In particular, the latest version of the data have some
ecoregion (MEOW) differences that mean that some of the 2020
ecoregions are not absent and there are now some ecoregions in the
data that were not present in the 2020 data.  The combinations of
figures listed below are aligned with the ecoregions present in the
2020 report and therefore are missing some ecoregions:

- Amazonia
- Arafura Sea
- Cargados Carajos/Tromelin Island
- Clipperton
- Eastern India
- Guianan
- Halmahera
- Southeast Madagascar
- Western India


And contain some ecoregions for which there are no associated xgboost
models:

- Cocos Islands
- Northern Gulf of Mexico
- Northern Galapagos Islands
- Western Galapagos Islands
-->

### Subregion level

Subregion level estimates are generated by calculating weighted
averages of Ecoregion posteriors (at the draw level). Weights are
based on relative reef areas of the Ecoregions as calculated from
Coral Reefs of the World spatial layers.

Note, the weights are caculated as the relative reef areas of the
Ecoregions **for which there were observed data**.  There were eight
Ecoregions for which there were no observed/available benthic data for
this installment of the GCRMN report:

- Amazonia
- Arafura Sea
- Cargados Carajos/Tromelin Island
- Clipperton
- Eastern India
- Guianan
- Halmahera
- Ogasawara Islands
- Southeast Madagascar
- Western India

Within Subregions, tremporal trends are represented by two figures:

- top left: Bayesian Hierachical (orange) and xgboost (blue) estimates
  for the entire GCRMN temporal domain 

- top right: Bayesian Hierachical (orange) and xgboost (blue)
  estimates for the temporal domain of the observed data for that
  Subregion
